Description:
This map uses a choropleth style to represent the percentage share of vote per constituency for the winning party. The data is binned into four categories:

25% â€“ 39% (lightest green)
40% â€“ 53%
54% â€“ 67%
68% â€“ 81% (darkest green)

Purpose:
Highlights how dominant the winning party was in each constituency. Darker greens reflect stronger electoral majorities, while lighter greens show more marginal wins.
